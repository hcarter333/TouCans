# TouCans  
Project TouCans is a ham radio build of a Rockmite modified for 750 mW output feeding a TunaTopper II+ amplifier. Both components are housed in a pineapple can with a tuna can as a roof.  ![image](https://github.com/hcarter333/TouCans/assets/363004/7b2486cf-2860-454f-baad-976f09169ea0)  
The rig lives in the antenna in an attempt to avoid feedline losses, imbalances, and other issues.
